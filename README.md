### Hi there 🖖

My name is Chris. I am a full stack developer and software architect. 

I love coding and I love working with Go 🚀 and nodejs with Typescript 🐬, I also love native iOS development using Swift 🏎️ and SwiftUI.

- 🔭 I’m currently working with Go and Nodejs on both REST and GraphQL Microservices. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning gRPC because I feel that it's a perfect fit for Microservices.
- 🤖 I would love to be better at working with Docker and K8s.

🏖️ Have a great day!
